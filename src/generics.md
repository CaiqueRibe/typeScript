# What are Generics
Generics in TypeScript provide a way to create reusable components that can work with multiple data types. 
They allow you to parameterize types and functions, making them adaptable and flexible.

<!-- --------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

# Generic Functions
Use generics to create functions that can work with various data types. This allows you to write more generic and reusable code. ]
# Generic Interfaces:
Use generics in interfaces to create flexible data structures or objects that can work with different types. For example:
# Generic Classes:
Use generics in classes to create reusable components that can work with various types. This is particularly useful when building data structures like linked lists, stacks, or queues.

# Summary
In these examples, you can see how generics allow us to create versatile and reusable code by parameterizing types and functions, interfaces, or classes. This flexibility makes TypeScript code more generic and adaptable to different data types, enhancing code quality and maintainability.
